<ul>
  <li>Spring 2017: Characterized a comparator device for antithetic integral feedback in budding yeast.</li>
  <li>Summer 2017: Optimized the comparator by testing new synthetic transcription factors. Tested Cas9 gRNA-acceptor vectors for quick design and assembly. Used the new CRISPR system to make knockout strains of a CPR in the BIA pathway. Built and tested a new plasmid backbone containing a HIS auxotrophy marker from C. glabrata that did not lead to a growth defect — unlike the previous version used in lab.</li>
  <li>Fall 2017: Designed, built, and tested yeast strains for optimal on-pathway flux of the BIA pathway.
