I"c<p>My final project in Genetic Design Automation helped develop my understanding of Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework to develop a comprehensive visualizer for the penultimate project in the course. When collaborating with my project partner, we noticed that the exceptions thrown by the program helped to validate the truism of her project implementation. Once the course ended, I continued to work on features of the visualizer to serve as a validation program. I plan to make more validation programs to further develop the new course offered through the Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley.</p>
