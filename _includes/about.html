					<h3>Professional Profile</h3>
					<p>Hello! I'm an undergraduate at the University of California Berkeley currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics. I love my combination of fields, and I love sharing the beauties of them to all my students. In my free time I enjoy shooting archery, running marathons, and scarfing down twelve pounds of crawfish!</p>
					<p>My passion is learning, whether it be for theory, language, or social change. In my free time, I volunteer in many STEM programs in the community to promote STEM education to minorities. I am the currently the outreach chair for the Mathematics Undergraduate Students Association at UC Berkeley, and I currently work as the webmaster for UC Berkeley's Masters in Developmental Practice Department.</p>
