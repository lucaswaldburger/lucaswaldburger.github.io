title: Video Lectures for Biophysical Chemistry
description: |
---

What started as a way to review course material and problem sets eventually became a lecture series to help students struggling in Biophysical Chemistry I. As a teaching assistant for the course, I am now trying to make more material outside of discussion section since my focus have been largely on problem sets than fundamental concepts. I found videos to be a better medium for learning since they allow students to pause and replay sections. While I enjoy working in person with students, I have gained positive feedback from more students than I could help in one-on-one tutoring.
