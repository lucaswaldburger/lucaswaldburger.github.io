<i class="fa fa-trophy"></i> Best CRISPR Assembly Software | UC Berkeley Department of Bioengineering
<br>

Over Summer 2017 I helped develop a CRISPR assembly system that uses BbsI sites to incorporate a protospacer into a Cas9 acceptor vector. The system had several downstream issues when automating the design of gRNA and repair DNA oligos through a MS Excel spreadsheet. After several failed assemblies, I dedicated a weekend to design a basic Python GUI that would allow users to copy and paste information from Benchling then copy and paste an outputted TSV file into IDT. Aside from reducing burden, the program also cross-validated the results to ensure that the correct oligos were designed in an attempt minimize any human errors. The approach that I used was selected as the best assembly software in Genetic Design Automation through the Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley.
