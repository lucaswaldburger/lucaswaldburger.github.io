## About Me

I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley co-advised by [Jay Keasling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MO3BwFMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Patrick Shih](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VKT_9m4AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am grateful to have my work supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
